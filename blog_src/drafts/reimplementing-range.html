<p>In this blog post, we'll recreate our own implementation of Python's <code>range()</code> function. There's a surprising amount of power and programming concepts behind this familiar function. The <code>range()</code> function is one of the first things beginners learn in Python. It's useful for <code>for</code> loops when you need to run a block of code a certain number of times:</p>

<pre>for i in range(5):
    print('My name is Johnny Five Times.')</pre>

<p>This will output:</p>

<pre>My name is Johnny Five Times.
My name is Johnny Five Times.
My name is Johnny Five Times.
My name is Johnny Five Times.
My name is Johnny Five Times.</pre>

<p>This <code>for</code> loop will also set <code>i</code>, the loop variable, to the values 0 to 4 (that is, up to but not including 5). You can provide two arguments to <code>range()</code> to give it a starting value besides 0:</p>

<pre>for i in range(3, 6):
    print(i)</pre>

<p>...and this code outputs:</p>

<pre>3
4
5</pre>

<p>You can also provide three arguments for a start, stop, and "step" value. The <code>i</code> variable ("i" is conventionally used because it is short and often the loop variable acts as an <em>index</em> into a data structure) will increase by two in this loop:</p>

<pre>for i in range(3, 9, 2):
    print(i)</pre>

<p>...and this code outputs:</p>

<pre>3
5
7</pre>

<p>But in Python, <strong>you can use several types of values with for loops</strong>. You can use lists, strings, or <code>dict_items</code> objects returned by the <code>items()</code> dictionary method:</p>

<pre>for char in 'Hello':
    print(char)

for item in ['cats', 'dogs']:
    print(item)

for key, value in {'cat': 'Zophie', 'dog': 'Indiana'}.items():
    print(key, value)</pre>

<p>...and this code outputs:</p>

<pre>H
e
l
l
o
cats
dogs
cat Zophie
dog Indiana</pre>

<p><strong>What these values have in common is that their data types are "iterables".</strong> They are values that contain multiple values that can be presented to a <code>for</code> loop one at a time. This even applies to <em>unordered</em> data types like dictionaries. (Dictionaries contain multiple values, but there is no "first" or "last" value like lists have.)</p>
