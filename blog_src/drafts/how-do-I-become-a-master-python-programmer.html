it's not computer science or programming, but mastering the python language. this isn't algorithms or advanced mathematics or machine learning.

I have a number of steps and a general order, but feel free to skip around if you want.

fluent python, effective python, python cookbook

watch pycon videos by raymond hettinger. take notes, when they type code into the interactive shell, type along with them.

exercism.io for practice

pymotw - specific modules

data object model in the docs

get to the point where you can actually read the official python documentation and make sense of them.
