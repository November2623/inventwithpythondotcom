      <h2>Chapter 2 - Pygame Basics</h2>

      <p><strong>On page 23</strong>, there is the sentence, "Unfortunately, there isn’t a single function you can call that will set a single pixel to a color". Actually, there is the <code><a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/surface.html#pygame.Surface.set_at">set_at()</a></code> and <code><a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/surface.html#pygame.Surface.get_at">get_at()</a></code> methods for <code>Surface</code> objects. <em>(Thanks to Ben LeBlanc)</em></p>

      <h2>Chapter 3 - Memory Puzzle</h2>

      <p><strong>Figure 3-3</strong> has the X and Y coordinates for the box coordinates reversed. <em>(Thanks to tile ile)</em></p>

      <p><strong>Line 224</strong> of the memory puzzle program is <code>for coverage in range(BOXSIZE, (-REVEALSPEED) - 1, - REVEALSPEED):</code>, but that second argument (<code>(-REVEALSPEED) - 1</code>) could be simplified to just <code>-1</code> and the program would work just fine. This isn't a bug, but the code is kind of confusing.

      </p><h2>Chapter 4 - Slide Puzzle</h2>

      <p><strong>On page 85</strong>, there is the sentence, "Much of the code in Wormy is similar to the previous games we’ve looked at, especially the constants being set at the start of the code." which should actually read, "Much of the code in <span class="typoCorrection">Slide Puzzle</span> is similar to the previous games we’ve looked at, especially the constants being set at the start of the code." <em>(Thanks to Ben LeBlanc)</em></p>

      <p><strong>Line 151 of slidePuzzle.py</strong> has an extra closing parentheses at the end of the line. <em>(Thanks to Eduardo França)</em></p>

      <p><strong>On page 97</strong>, there is "Depending on if the blank space is at the edge of the board, lines 184 to 191 will remove other directional values from the lastMove list. Of the values that are left in lastMove, one of them is randomly selected with a call to random.choice() and returned." should be "Depending on if the blank space is at the edge of the board, lines 184 to 191 will remove other directional values from the <span class="typoCorrection">validMoves</span> list. Of the values that are left in <span class="typoCorrection">validMoves</span>, one of them is randomly selected with a call to random.choice() and returned." <em>(Thanks to Tyler Mitchell)</em></p>

      <p><strong>On page 100</strong>, there is the sentence "Finally, we draw the buttons off to the slide of the screen" which should be "Finally, we draw the buttons off to the <span class="typoCorrection">side</span> of the screen" <em>(Thanks to Tyler Michell)</em></p>

      <h2>Chapter 5 - Simulate</h2>

      <p><strong>On page 129</strong>, the sentence "We could have left line 47 out entirely" should be "We could have left line <span class="typoCorrection">247</span> out entirely". <em>(Thanks to C. Whitt)</em></p>

      <h2>Chapter 6 - Wormy</h2>

      <p><strong>On page 131</strong>, the sentence "...a new apply randomly appears on the screen." should be "...a new <span class="typoCorrection">apple</span> randomly appears on the screen." <em>(Thanks to C. Whitt)</em></p>


      <h2>Chapter 10 - Four Extra Games</h2>

      <p><strong>On page 305</strong>, the sentence "If the player gets board of the colors..." should be "If the player gets bored of the colors..." <em>(Thanks to David Keck)</em></p>
