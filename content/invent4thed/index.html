  <h1 class="display-3">Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python, 4th Edition</h1>
  <p><em>Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python</em> teaches you how to program in the Python language. Each chapter gives you the complete source code for a new game, and then teaches the programming concepts from the examples. Games include Guess the Number, Hangman, Tic Tac Toe, and Reversi. This book also has an introduction to making games with 2D graphics using the Pygame framework.</p>

  <p>"It's a great introduction to Python and a great introduction to building fairly simple but interesting games. The author's not just a talented coder, but a Python maestro. And his programming techniques provide good lessons on how to approach programming tasks."</p>
